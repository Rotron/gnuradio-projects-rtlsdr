commrx is a communications receiver using rtl-sdr
controls:
  100s tuning steps of 100Mhz
  10s  tuning steps of 10Mhz
  1s   tuning steps of 1Mhz
  fsel slider 000 to 999khz steps of 1khz
  AM,NFM,WFM,USB,LSB select receive mode
  UPCONVERT  selects frequency readout for a 125Mhz upconverter for HF bands (only changes readout, does not change spectrum  analyzer readout yet)
  gain   rf gain 0-50db
  squelch    squelch works in all modes
  spectrum analyzer controls change the behavior of the analyzer display.  if you get stuttering audio, setting the FFT to less than 1024 sometimes helps. setting the receive mode to AM, then selecting other modes helps too...
  i might add a fine tuning control (100hz or 10hz steps) because the rtl dongle needs it, going to USB or LSB while tuned into an AM mode station will show you why ;)  i might add BB and IF gain controls as well. this is basically a first draft.  
  wish list: add police scanner type operation using a list of frequencies plus auto selecting the receive mode on each list line.
  (including adding P25 and amateur digital voice modes)
