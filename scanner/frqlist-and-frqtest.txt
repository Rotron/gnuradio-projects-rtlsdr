frqlist.py is a simple frequency list creator. frqedit.py is a rudimentary editor of the frequency list created by frqlist.py.
it can modify entries in the list, and append entries to the list. frqlist is good for adding many entries at once, 
since it opens the file in append mode, and you just need to tell it how many entries are being added.
frqedit can modify existing entries, and can also append (but it asks you after each entry if you want to add another one).
frqedit opens the file in write mode, so it overwrites the original file. i will likely add a backup function to it.

all entries are in Hz, so 155.125Mhz is 155125000.  the 32bit values occasionally end up with the entry off a few Hz (such
as an entry for 145145000 becoming 145144992.0) but for 99.99% of the uses of the scanner, it shouldn't matter (the local
oscillator resolution of a typical rtl dongle is 10hz).
